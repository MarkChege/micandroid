        <h1>Welcome to SoNingbo</h1>
        <h2>We are currenlty in  a beta version</h2>
        <p>Back when Ningbo was small, we all knew each other, and we knew where everything was and there was a great sence of community.</p>
        <p>These days Ningbo is a huge city with millions of residents and thousands of locations, finding our way around while staying connected to  our firends can be a modern challenge.</p>
        <p>It's like we're surrounded by everything and everyone we need in Ningbo but we're not connected to it. </p>
        <p>In fact we often stick to what we know. I mean think about it, there are thousands of places that we havent explored yet within Ningbo</p>
        <p>The problem is that there are simply too many choices.</p>
